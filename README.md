# Shopping Report Builder

This tool simplifies the process of extracting reports from [the Reporting API
in Google Merchant Center](
    https://developers.google.com/shopping-content/guides/reports/overview) for
users who are less familiar with coding.

## The Problem
The Google Merchant Center UI doesn't allow exporting all available fields. This
can be a hurdle for users who need specific data for tasks like optimization,
but lack the technical expertise to access it via the Reporting API directly.

## Solution
This project offers a user-friendly interface embedded within Google Sheets.
Users can construct custom queries based on the Content API to extract specific
data from Merchant Center. The extracted information is then populated directly
into the Google Sheet, ready for analysis and further reporting.

![UI Overview](./docs/images/ui-overview.png)

## Getting Started
The easiest method for most users is to:

1. Create a copy of [this Google Sheet](
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rPTfluBVhydjXS8BSnI8xHtk3ilzaBA_VnRMw3Y40HY/edit).
2. Go to `Extensions` -> `Apps Script`.
![Open Apps Script screenshot](./docs/images/open-apps-script.png)
3. Deploy the UI:
   1. Press `Deploy` -> `New Deployment`
      ![New Deployment screenshot](./docs/images/new-deployment.png)
   2. Press `Deploy` in the pop up:
      ![Deploy popup screenshot](./docs/images/deployment-popup.png)
   3. Copy and save the URL from the window: this is where you view the UI:
      ![Deploy success screenshot](./docs/images/successful-deployment.png)
4. Open the deployment URL for the UI. The first time you do this you'll see a
   pop up about permissions. You need to press the `review permissions` button,
   and approve the app access.
   ![review permissions](./docs/images/review-permissions.png)
   Note about Permissions: You might see a warning that this app isn't verified
   by Google. This is because the script uses Google's built-in, default project configuration to make it easy for anyone to use without needing to set up
   their own, more complex, Google Cloud project. The script only accesses your
   Google Sheet and Merchant Center data to generate reports as you request it,
   and the code is open for you to review.
   To proceed, press `Show Advanced` and `Go to Shopping Report Builder | Prod`.
   ![unverified app warning](./docs/images/unverified-app-warning.png)
   After passing the permission warnings, you should now see the UI, and be able
   to run reports. See [example queries](#example-queries) for some inspiration
   to get started.

   **Organisational Policies:** If you encounter issues with permissions, your
   Google Workspace policies might necessitate using a custom Cloud project (see
   below).

### Custom Cloud Project

For enhanced control or due to organisational restrictions, you can use a custom
Google Cloud project instead of the default Apps Script project.

To set up a custom project:

1. **Follow Google's Guide:** Refer to [Switch to a different standard Google
    Cloud Platform project](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/cloud-platform-projects#switch_to_a_different_standard).
2. **Assign Required Roles:**
    * In the IAM & Admin section of your Google Cloud Console, grant the
    following roles to users who will be deploying the Apps Script project:
        * **Project Browser:** Allows viewing of project resources.
        * **OAuth Config Editor:** Permits management of OAuth configurations.
3. **Enable the Shopping Content API:** Activate
    `shoppingcontent.googleapis.com` within your Cloud project.
4. **Configure OAuth Consent Screen:**
    * Navigate to the [OAuth consent screen](
        https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) in your
        Google Cloud Console.
    * Follow the instructions to configure the screen. Ensure you select the
    appropriate user type (Internal or External) and provide the necessary
    application details.


### Optional Config

#### Merchant ID Autocomplete
The UI has an autocomplete on the merchant ID field to save you having to
remember your IDs. These values are pulled from Column A of the "Config" sheet.
You do not need to select one of these options in the UI, so this is optional.

The description column is to provide some helpful notes if you have a few
accounts.

## Advanced Users

### Manual Deployment (For users comfortable with Node.js and clasp)

These instructions guide you through a manual deployment process using the clasp
tool:

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Ensure you have an up-to-date installation of
   Node.js and npm ([guide](
    https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)).
2. **Install clasp**: Install clasp globally by running:
   `npm install @google/clasp -g.`
3. **Login with clasp**: Log in to clasp using `clasp login`.
4. **Enable Apps Script API**: Navigate to [the Apps Script Settings page](
   https://script.google.com/corp/home/usersettings) and enable the Apps Script
   API.
5. **Get App Script ID**: Create a new Google Sheet. Go to Extensions -> App
   Script -> Project settings and copy the project ID.
6. **Configure clasp**:
  - Run `cp example.clasp.json .clasp.json` (copies a configuration file).
  - Update the `scriptId` property in the `.clasp.json` file with the App Script
    ID you copied in step 5.
7. Deploy the script: Run `./deploy.sh` to deploy the script to your Google Apps
   Script project.


### Local Development (For developers who want to contribute)

For developers interested in contributing to the UI development, standard
Angular commands can be used:

`ng serve`: Starts the development server.

Mock data is returned in development, it does not query the API. If you enter a
merchant ID of 1, it will return a mock error.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- `/backend`: Contains all the Google Apps Script code responsible for
  interacting with the Reporting API and populating the Sheet.
- `/ui`: Contains the Angular code for the user interface.

The subdirectories are configured to build the production code in a shared
`/dist` folder in the parent directory. Clasp then pushes all these files to
Apps Script.

## Example Queries
